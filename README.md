# Friendly_BOT
Friendly BOT is an assistance for any common man and a specially challenged person. This standalone assistant interacts solely through the user’s voice and actions. It helps user in complex tasks, computing arithmetic problems, searching Wikipedia and monitoring the house and individual as well as a security at home. The user calls the system by speaking a keyword (“Omega”) through the microphone, following which the system signals the user (through a beep) to speak the task he wishes to accomplish. The user speaks the voice command and the system gives the output through the speakers attached to the system.
